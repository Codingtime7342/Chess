            Chess is a sport but before being a sport it was kinda like a battle map. You have 8 soliders who move 1 or 2 in the start then 1 from the rest and ( who can turn into the following peices) A knight is a tricky piece, it can move 2 spaces forward then turn left or right or move one and then turn left or right and move 2, unlike pawns knights and other pieces you will see can move backward and you get 2 of these mystery pieces, there are 2 bishops a light squared and a dark squared ones, they can only stay on their color so the light squared bishop can only move on the light squares on the board and the dark squared bishop can only move on the dark squares.
<br>
       Now for the better pieces, you get 2 rooks and they are very useful. They can move forward any where they want. Fact did you know that the rook can get to any square in 1-2 moves! The queen is the most strongest piece. it can move like any piece except like a knight. It can't move like a knight and can't jump over pieces. The king is last. The king is the piece you have to protect and attack the other king. it can move in every direction. If the king is getting attacked and can't move anywhere then you or they lose. Hope you enjoyed!            </p>
